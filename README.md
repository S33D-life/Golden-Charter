# Golden-Charter
S33D is a distributed seed &amp; story library that seeks to recalibrate the value of seed saving and storytelling within both our local and global economies.  A living trade canvas of ancient DNA encoded with cryptographic precision - S33D is a marriage between the ancient and modern worlds, germinating a suit of tools to assist a reconnect with our origins through education, trade, and localised community curation.After many years dreaming, on the 5th November 2018 we hashed our first version of the Golden Dream onto the Bitcoin Blockchain and distributed it to friends and family, leaving behind a printed copy in the Aloha Pod.  We envisage the Golden Dream metamorphosing into the Golden Charter for V3, allowing members of the community to propose &amp; vote on solutions and changes to this living document. If a threshold of the community agree on a revision, it becomes the new charter. However, all previous versions will still be browsable, as are proposed changes in order of popularity and recent submissions.
